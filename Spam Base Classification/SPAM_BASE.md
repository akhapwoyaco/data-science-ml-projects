# SPAM BASE CLASSIFICATION'

## Introduction

Email as a means of digital communication has been in use since the internet boom, both formally and informally. Companies use email as a means to provide further updates to their customers concerning products. However, emails have been misused, spam emails have been flooding into email users inbox with fake advertisements leading to phony sites, with links containing phishing links and pyramid schemes.

The need to sieve genuine from spam email guides our analysis, with the use of datasets on frequently occuring wordings from both spam and non spam email to build a spam classification model. The data is pre-processed, and used to train classification models that in turn are used on new data for classification purposes. The efficiency of the model is based upon the accuracy of correct classification of observations into either of the spam or non spam category.
