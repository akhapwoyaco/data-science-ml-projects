# [Machine Learning Modelling: Early Incident Identification](Early%20Incident%20Identification)

Guiding our analysis is the Disc Consulting (DCE) data on IP Packet event records, that has identified malicious and non-malicious event record within their networks and computer systems, for which the attacks are more sophisticated than previously experienced attacks, with no clue on the methods used for intrusion.

A suggested approach is incorporate a real-time threat detection system based on machine learning classification models to categorize an record event as either malicious or not based on IP packets attributes. Performance measures and model selection, will be assessed inline with the scope of the DCE objectives.

# [Titanic Survival: Logistic Regression & KNN](TITANIC)

The Titanic data set provides a sample of passengers, with some basic details: their names, ages, gender, class, and several others. We are predicting a binary response: whether the passenger survived or died.

# [Spam Base Classification](Spam%20Base%20Classification)

## Data

The [Spambase Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/). 

# [predictors for better health outcomes at the county level in the United States](SocialScienccesMortality)

Research Plan: What are the predictors for better health outcomes at the county level in the United States?

I use a combination of the data to establish a theory of ecological health outcomes and an explanatory model. The 
dependent variable will be the Premature age-adjusted mortality variable in sheet 6 of data. 

Data provided: Data file of different health outcomes at the level of US counties, from the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.
