# [Machine Learning Modelling: Early Incident Identification](Early%20Incident%20Identification)

Guiding our analysis is the Disc Consulting (DCE) data on IP Packet event records, that has identified malicious and non-malicious event record within their networks and computer systems, for which the attacks are more sophisticated than previously experienced attacks, with no clue on the methods used for intrusion.

A suggested approach is incorporate a real-time threat detection system based on machine learning classification models to categorize an record event as either malicious or not based on IP packets attributes. Performance measures and model selection, will be assessed inline with the scope of the DCE objectives.

# [Titanic Survival: Logistic Regression & KNN](TITANIC)

The Titanic data set provides a sample of passengers, with some basic details: their names, ages, gender, class, and several others. We are predicting a binary response: whether the passenger survived or died.


# [Spam Base Classification](./Spam Base Classification)

- Classification of The Spambase Data Set was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
